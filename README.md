# Yodo Peak Translator

Welcome to the "Yodo Peak Translator" repository! This fun application allows you to translate English language into Yodish, the language spoken by Yoda, a beloved character from Star Wars. The translation is made possible using the Yoda Speak API.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain an API key from the Yoda Speak API provider.
3. Replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder in the `yodo_peak_translator.js` file with your actual API key.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
5. Enter your English text in the input field.
6. Click the "Translate" button to see the Yodish translation.

## Example

Suppose you enter the following English text:

```
May the Force be with you.
```

After clicking the "Translate" button, the application will display:

```
The Force be with you, may.
```

## How It Works

The Yodo Peak Translator utilizes the Yoda Speak API to translate English text into Yodish. The API request is made with your input text, and the response contains the Yodish translation.
